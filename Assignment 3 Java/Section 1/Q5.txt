// Error to investigate: Why does this loop not print numbers in the expected order? What is the problem with the initialization and update statements in the `for` loop?
Answer->1.Because,i >= 0 (Runs as long as i is greater than or equal to 0).Update Statement: i++,i++ increases i in each iteration, making it grow indefinitely instead of decreasing. Since i starts at 10, it becomes 11, 12, 13...The condition i >= 0 is always true after the first iteration â†’ Infinite Loop.
2.Use i-- to properly decrement i and ensure the loop terminates at 0.
