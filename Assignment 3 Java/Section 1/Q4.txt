// Error to investigate: What is the issue with the loop boundaries? How should the loop be adjusted to meet the 
expected output?
Answer->1.The loop starts with i = 1.The condition is i <= 10, meaning it includes 10 in the output. Since i increments by 1 (i++), the loop runs for 10 iterations.
2.Change condition to i < 10 to exclude 10 and stop at 9.
