public class MisplacedForLoopBody { 
 public static void main(String[] args) { 
 for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) 
 System.out.println(i); 
 System.out.println("Done"); 
 } 
} 


// Error to investigate: Why does "Done" print only once, outside the loop? How should the loop body be enclosed to 
include all statements within the loop?
Answer->
1.Missing {} made "Done" execute only once after the loop.
2.Use {} to enclose both System.out.println(i); and System.out.println("Done");.
