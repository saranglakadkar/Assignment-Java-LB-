public class LoopVariableScope { 
 public static void main(String[] args) { 
 for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) { 
 int x = i * 2; 
 } 
 System.out.println(x); // Error: 'x' is not accessible here 
 } 
} 


// Error to investigate: Why does the variable 'x' cause a compilation error? How does scope

Answer->
A variable declared inside a block {} is only accessible within that block.The variable x is declared inside the for loop, so it only exists inside the loop.Once the loop ends, x is destroyed and cannot be accessed outside the loop.
