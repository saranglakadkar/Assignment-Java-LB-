// Error to investigate: Why does the loop execute indefinitely? What is wrong with the loop condition?
Answer->1.Infinite loop due to the incorrect condition num == 10.
2.Instead of stopping, the loop continues because the increment operator (++) is not breaking the loop due to the way the condition is evaluated.
