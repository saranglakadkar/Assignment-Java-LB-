Q12. What happens when you run this code? How can you avoid infinite loops?
Answer-> code run in infinite loop because condition is always true.
1.Always make sure your loop has a condition that will eventually end.
2.Use break or increment/decrement logic inside the loop to avoid infinite loops.
