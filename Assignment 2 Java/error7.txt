Q7. What compilation error do you see? Why does Java enforce type safety?
answer-> error is incompatible types because we are trying to assign string to an integer variable x.
1.java is statically typed language. 
2.java ensure operation are performed on correct data types to reduce unexpected crashes.
3.java allocates memory based on data types.(e.g. int takes 4bytes).
