
public class Main { 
 public static void main(String[] args) { 
 System.out.println("Hello, World!"); 
 // Missing closing brace here 
} 


Q.What does the compiler say about mismatched braces?
-> The compiler will throw a "reached end of file while parsing" error because the closing brace (}) for the main method or the Main class is missing.
