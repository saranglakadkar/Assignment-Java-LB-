Q17. What compilation error occurs? Why is the ** operator not valid in Java?
Answer->The code will not compile due to the usage of the ** operator. Java does not support the ** operator for exponentiation.
1.In Java, the ** operator is not defined for exponentiation, which is why you encounter a compilation error.
2.Java uses standard mathematical operators for basic arithmetic operations like addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/), but does not have an operator for exponentiation like some other languages (e.g., Python).
