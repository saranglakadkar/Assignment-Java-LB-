Q. Error to Investigate: Why does this code not compile? What does the error tell you about the 
types allowed in switch expressions? How can you modify the code to make it work?

->1.The issue in the given code is that the switch expression uses a double type, which is not allowed in Java. The Java switch statement only supports the following types.
2.error: incompatible types: possible lossy conversion from double to int
switch(score) {
       ^
3.switch does not support double due to precision issues with floating-point numbers.we can use if-else statements when working with floating-point comparisons
