Q.Error to Investigate: Why does the default case print after "Value is 2"? How can you prevent 
the program from executing the default case?
->1.In the given switch-case statement, there are no break statements after each case. In Java, switch cases execute sequentially  unless a break statement is used.
2.To prevent unintended execution of the next cases, use break after each case.
