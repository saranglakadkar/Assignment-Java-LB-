Q4. What happens when you compile and run this code? Why is String[] args needed?
Answer->1.code compile successfully but doesn't not run because main() method doesn't have parameters.
2.JVM specifically Searches for public static void main(String[] args).
If parameters are missing or different, JVM cannot start execution.
