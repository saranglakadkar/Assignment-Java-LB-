public class Main { 
 public static void main(String[] args) { 
 static void displayMessage() { 
 System.out.println("Message"); 
 } 
 } 
} 


Q.What syntax error occurs? Can a method be declared inside another method?
->1.Yes, there is a syntax error because the method displayMessage() is declared inside the main() method, which is not allowed in Java.
2.No, Java does not support method declarations inside other methods. All methods must be declared at the class level, not within another method
