Q9. What error occurs? Why can't reserved keywords be used as identifiers?
Answer-> error: identifier expected.
code will not compile because class is reserved keyword in java.it cannot be used as a variable.
1.Java reserved keywords are predefined words that have special meanings in the language.
They cannot be used as variable names, method names, or class names.and to maintain readability.
