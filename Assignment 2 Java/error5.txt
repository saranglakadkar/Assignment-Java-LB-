 public class Main { 
 public static void main(String[] args) { 
 System.out.println("Main method with String[] args"); 
 } 
 public static void main(int[] args) { 
 System.out.println("Overloaded main method with int[] args"); 
 } 
} 

*/ Q5.Can you have multiple main methods? What do you observe?
answer-> code compile successfully but run main(Static[] args) because jvm recognizes this method as the entry point.
 1.Multiple main() methods are allowed.
 2.JVM only calls main(String[] args) automatically.
 3.Overloaded main() methods must be called manually inside the program.
