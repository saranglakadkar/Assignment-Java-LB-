Q15.What error occurs when compiling this code? How should you handle different data types in operations?
answer->error: incompatible types: possible lossy conversion from double to int
    int result = num1 + num2;
                           ^
The code will not compile due to a type mismatch when adding an int and a double. The result of the addition of an int and a double is a double, but you are trying to assign it to an int variable (result).
1.if we type cast int result to double output is =15.5.
2.implicit cast for result int(result) num1+num2 = 15
