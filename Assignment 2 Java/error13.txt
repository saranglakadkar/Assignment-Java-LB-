Q13. What exception is thrown? Why does it occur?
 answer->The code will throw a NullPointerException at runtime.
1.In the code, the String variable str is initialized to null (it does not point to any actual String object).
2.When we call str.length(), we're attempting to call a method on a null object reference, which causes a NullPointerException.
