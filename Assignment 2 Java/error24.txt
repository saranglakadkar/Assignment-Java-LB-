public class MissingBreakCase { 
 public static void main(String[] args) {

Q. Error to Investigate: When level is 1, why does it print "Level 1", "Level 2", "Level 3", and 
"Unknown level"? What is the role of the break statement in this situation?

->
1.In the given switch-case statement, there are no break statements after each case. In Java, switch cases execute sequentially unless a break statement is used.
2.The break statement prevents fall-through by stopping execution after a matching case. Without break, all cases after the matching one execute sequentially until the end of the switch block.
