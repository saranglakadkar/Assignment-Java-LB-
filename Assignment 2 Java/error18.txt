Q18. What is the output of this code? How does operator precedence affect the result?
answer->The output of this code is 20.
1.Operator Precedence defines the order in which operators are evaluated in an expression. In this case, the multiplication operator (*) takes precedence over the addition operator (+).

Order of Operations:

Multiplication (b * 2), because * has higher precedence than +.
Then addition (a + 10).
This is similar to the BODMAS rule (Brackets, Orders, Division/Multiplication, Addition/Subtraction), which dictates the order of operations.
